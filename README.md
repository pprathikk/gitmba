CLOUD STRATEGY FOR A SME - 
MAGIC GLOW 
(A Clothing Store)


Abstract

The primary objective of this assignment is to describe and justify a cloud strategy for Magic Glow Retail, a small/medium enterprise (SME) operating in the retail industry. The assignment will include the background of the enterprise, current IT setup, and recommendations for cloud vs non-cloud solutions for each aspect of the infrastructure, along with justifications for the final recommendations provided.


Background of Magic Glow Retail

Magic Glow Retail is a medium-sized clothing store with multiple branches across different cities. The company offers a wide range of clothing apparel and accessories for men, women, and children. With a growing customer base and expanding operations, it should enhance its IT infrastructure to support its business goals and improve operational efficiency.

Current IT Setup

a. Hardware: The retailer currently uses on-premises servers and storage devices to manage its IT infrastructure. This includes servers for running applications, databases, and file storage as well.
b. Software: Magic Glow Retail utilizes a combination of licensed software applications for inventory management, point-of-sale systems, and customer relationship management (CRM). These applications are installed on individual computers at each store location.
c. Network Infrastructure: The company has a local area network (LAN) connecting its stores, enabling data sharing and communication between different branches. Data backups are performed manually on physical media.









Recommendations:

a. Contrast of Cloud vs Non-Cloud Solutions:
The tables highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
Cloud Storage Services vs. On-Premises Storage:
Aspect
Cloud Storage Services
On-Premises Storage
Scalability
Easily scalable up or down based on demand.
May require upfront investment for hardware upgrades.
Data Security
Robust security measures, including encryption and redundancy.
Offers complete control over data security.
Accessibility
Data is accessible from any internet-connected device.
Limited accessibility to the physical location.
Cost
Pay-as-you-go pricing model, cost-effective for SMEs.
Higher initial costs for hardware and maintenance.


Hosting Servers and Applications on Cloud vs. On-Premises Infrastructure:
Aspect
Cloud Hosting
On-Premises Infrastructure
Maintenance
Cloud service providers handle maintenance and updates.
Requires ongoing maintenance and monitoring.
Scalability
Easily scalable to accommodate increasing demands.
May involve hardware purchases for scaling up.
Performance
Multiple data centers for improved application performance.
Performance may be limited, especially for distant users.
Cost Effectiveness
Cost-effective due to reduced hardware and maintenance expenses.
Higher upfront costs for hardware and ongoing expenses.



Cloud-Based Backup and Disaster Recovery vs. Manual Backups:
Aspect
Cloud-Based Backup and Disaster Recovery
Manual Backups
Data Protection
Automated and regular backups for data protection.
Relies on manual efforts, may be less reliable.
Reliability
High levels of reliability and redundancy across data centers.
Risk of human error, less reliable.
Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs)
Shorter RTOs, quick recovery after a disaster.
Longer restoration time, leading to extended downtime.
Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs)
Frequent and automated backups, lower RPOs.
Less frequent backups, higher data loss potential.



b. Recommendation & Justification for Each Aspect:

i. Storage: It is recommended to adopt a cloud storage solution for Magic Glow Retail to improve scalability, accessibility, and data redundancy. Cloud storage offers the ability to easily scale up or down based on the shop's storage requirements. As the shop experiences seasonal variations in demand or expands its product offerings, cloud storage can accommodate the changing needs without the need for manual intervention. This ensures that the shop pays only for the storage resources it actually uses, optimizing cost efficiency. Public cloud storage services, such as Azure or Google Cloud Storage, would be suitable for the enterprise's needs. There are also other benefits such as remote access, data redundancy, and reduced infrastructure costs.

ii. Servers and Applications: It is proposed to migrate critical applications to the cloud, such as the inventory management system and CRM. A combination of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) models would be appropriate. Cloud-based solutions offer the flexibility to deploy, manage, and modify resources with ease. This agility empowers the shop to adapt to market demands swiftly and efficiently, without being limited by the constraints of on-premises hardware. For example, hosting virtual machines on a public cloud platform like Microsoft Azure, and utilizing a cloud-based CRM solution like Salesforce. It also boasts some extra benefits like Improved Scalability, Reduced Maintenance efforts, and potential cost savings.

iii. Data Backup and Disaster Recovery: Recommended to implement cloud-based backup and disaster recovery services to automate and streamline the process. Solutions such as AWS Backup or Azure Site Recovery would offer reliable data protection and faster recovery times. Cloud-based backup and disaster recovery solutions offer a higher level of reliability and data protection compared to manual processes. Automated backups reduce the risk of human error in the backup process, ensuring data is consistently backed up as per a predetermined schedule.

Conclusion
The cloud strategy for Magic Glow Retail is tailored to its unique requirements and business goals. By embracing cloud storage, cloud-based servers and applications, and cloud-based backup and disaster recovery services, the company can enhance operational efficiency, optimize costs, and position itself for sustainable growth in the competitive retail landscape. Embracing cloud technology with proper risk mitigation strategies will enable Magic Glow Retail to embrace the future of retail and serve its customers with excellence and be further ahead and ready for the future than its competitors.

Note: The example provided above is a hypothetical scenario. The specific deployment details and cloud service selection may vary based on the requirements and available cloud service providers.
